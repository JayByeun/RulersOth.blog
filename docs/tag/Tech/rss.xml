<blockquote>
  <p>I Disapprove of what you Say, <br />
But I Will Defend to the Death Your Right to Say it <br /></p>

  <p><strong>- Voltaire</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>        I asked the questions as below after watching <strong>‘/the Social Dilemma’</strong> and <strong>‘Children Of Men’</strong> at 1).</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>a) Freedom of access to information should be guaranteed?

b) Everyone has a right to freedom of expression?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The idea of a) is presented at <strong>Civilising Information - 1)</strong>. As I mentioned earlier, the access to information should be free, but the ethical responsibility of company about this freedom is inevitable at the same time. I believe that a proper intervention rather than censorship would be required for each ethical standards of company.</p>

<p>The necessity of intervention is specified through puzzling b) out.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59648602/107339251-c49dbd80-6abc-11eb-8a64-7a0b3f3b1e43.png" alt="quote" width="700px" /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>        The quote above is cited from the ending scene of <strong>‘/the Social Dilemma’</strong>. This quote presents the society of <strong>‘Children Of Men’</strong> which is losing production capacity of human and the rest are waiting for extinction of human species with devastated hope. I believe that this quote shows if no matter any good will lose their balance, it could not be easily concluded whether it achieves Utopia or drives self-destruction. Even if that will was good intention, we cannot say so sure of the end.
<br /></p>

<p>As written at <strong>Civilising Information -1), the freedom of access to information</strong> brought a desire to possess tremendous information and the learned users by this desire produce another information at Social Media such as Facebook and Instagram. This production enriched those platform with full and variety of information.
<br /></p>

<p>The fact that information is getting bigger and bigger brought the increase of users at such platform and the increasing popularity of platform caused the attention of advertisers. It is inevitable at this moment that the company obsesses the users’ Retention and Conversion data for their interests. The Algorithm which is developed for this purpose results in neglecting the production of inflammatory or incendiary contents. In this aspect, the point that we should not ignore is ‘the process of the producing and learning enormous information through the freedom of access to information’.
<br />
<br /></p>

<h4 id="the-freedom-of-access-to-information-works-the-freedom-of-speech">The Freedom of Access to Information works the Freedom of Speech</h4>

<p><br />
        The <strong>‘Freedom of Speech’</strong> is one of fundamental rights as important as the freedom of access to information. This fundamental rights are also applied to the Internet. The reason why I started this writing with the quote of Voltaire(actually Voltaire did not say that) stands here.
<br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I Disapprove of what you Say, <br />
But I Will Defend to the Death Your Right to Say it <br /></p>

  <p><strong>- Voltaire</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyone can have the right of the freedom of speech in civilised society. Such right make a country avoid that one particular idea rules all and let them evolve continuously to make better world. The freedom of speech helps for people to understand something different from their idea and give them a balance to deliver their idea safely. However, these are just part of positive function. The huge freedom always comes with blind spot.
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Politics</strong> are the most famous example that such freedom of speech can be used actively and extremely.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59648602/95574997-38a45800-0a2e-11eb-9b8f-ae06e1b40020.png" alt="immigrant" width="800px" /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="what-if-extreme-contents-are-only-spent-on-social-media">What if extreme contents are only spent on Social Media?</h5>

<p><br />
        Internet has built a space that people can deliver their political idea freely and anonymously through several process of developing. These days people refuse rather to be anonymous and try to show themselves confidently. Internet which helped to gather people and let them exchange their opinions, facts and important information whenever and wherever they want made people concentrate on what they really should think of. However, in this process, those tremendous information confronts the blind spot at the Social Media such as Facebook, Instagram and Tweeter. The result of this Algorithm is <strong>‘QAnon’</strong> which asserts conspiracy theory in such an extreme way particularly in Internet.
<br /></p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59648602/95576106-2a573b80-0a30-11eb-9df4-fc760147e288.png" alt="QAnon" width="500px" /></p>

<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size:.8em;">Image Copyright:https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54443878</span></div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>        Although Facebook held their ground on their ethical regulation about provocative comment of President Trump, they decided recently to ban all accounts which is connected to <strong>QAnon Conspiracy Theory</strong>. QAnon believes that President Trump can save the world and Trump advocated their freedom of speech. Thus, Trump leaved them to believe that he supports actually those group. QAnon is considered to cross the line because of their provocative information before U.S. Presidential Election.
<br /></p>

<p>The one of Conspiracy Theory of QAnon was ‘COVID-19 is fake’ and it has spread out all over the world, so even in Europe there were several demonstration related to QAnon. This society is well known as producing conspiracy theory with the right of the Freedom of Speech.
Eventually, the size of this society has been bigger than usual because of U.S. Presidential Election and Facebook decided as above.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="the-go-sign-of-them">The ‘go’ sign of them</h4>

<p><br />
        The extremists haven’t stopped collective actions and produced a lot of fake news. In Germany, the government started to restrict AfD(Alternative for Deutschland) which make the conflict of race, sex and politics extreme.</p>

<p>No matter which you stands between right and left, the extremist produce very provocative information and continuous expose of this information make people difficult to acknowledge what the fact is. The extreme or intense information let people getting emotional and them participate in easily without rational decision eventually. When people have the desire of participation of that, the movement which is not proved whether it’s fact or not but believes ‘it is right’ has power and became important. This is their justification and <strong>‘go sign’</strong>.</p>

<p>This extreme movement and producing conspiracy is presented well in <strong>‘Children of Men’</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59648602/95579003-1e21ad00-0a35-11eb-86e8-eec62f44d93c.png" alt="extremist" width="800px" /></p>

<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size:.8em;">Image Copyright:Netflix_ChildrenOfMen</span></div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>        In the movie, both of glorious idea with lofty purpose and the movement with hatred helped physical war in the middle of trying every possible means for their bigger goal. I believe that any other ideas and thought cannot be before humanity. When some great cause stands before humanity, the human will destroy themselves. <strong>‘Children of Men’</strong> make us imagine the result of that vividly.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="the-essence-of-human-being">The essence of human being</h4>

<p><br />
        <strong>‘Theo’</strong>, the main character of the movie, was a companion of <strong>‘Julien’</strong> whom they participated in an ideological movement with before, but he became thoroughly a pessimist because of the reality that make people lose their kids with their corruption and devastation. <strong>Theo</strong> has no basic goal of life to be alive and less hope than general citizens who live only for survive. ‘Theo’ is accidentally charged with protecting the last hope of human being and the last life. With this mission he is finding his purpose of life again. In the process of the mission he was helped not by people from the government who run and make laws but by <strong>‘Marika’</strong> who is refugee and barely alive. It was very impressive that he could complete the mission in the middle of flying bombs and bullets with <strong>Marika’s</strong> help.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59648602/95580930-70180200-0a38-11eb-8054-c8c236d2224a.png" alt="marika1" width="500px" />
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59648602/95580946-74441f80-0a38-11eb-882a-6a721012917a.png" alt="marika2" width="500px" /></p>

<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size:.8em;">Image Copyright:Netflix_ChildrenOfMen</span></div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>        I think that <strong>‘Marika’</strong> and <strong>‘Theo’</strong> show the most important part of human being. They represent the general people who have been at several historical war such as in this movie and in the Korean War and who have thanked the survival of the day before having political ideas and thoughts. When left guns are put on their head and also when right guns are aimed at their head, they could not help putting their hands up and surrender for living and their family. We can see those people from <strong>‘Marika’</strong>.
<br /></p>

<p><strong>‘Theo’</strong> shows how valuable that we live with a purpose even though we live only one day. Likewise, humanity often roles very important in the movies based on dystopia.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="if-so-who-should-take-the-ethical-responsibility">If so, who should take the ethical responsibility?</h5>

<p><br />
I want to say that it is for both company and individuals.</p>

<p>        Human being is very weak for temptation but human cannot easily discards their Humanity which is very noble and lofty in dark days for lawless as the movie. <strong>Human can make self-purification in the middle of chaos and disorder.</strong> This is why human can have developed the culture over the past era. This is their history and the essence of live.</p>

<p>Like we made our equality through guaranteeing the political right for everyone and like we punish pedophile with strong action and laws, we stand on the aspect which self-purification is required.
This is not to deprive the rights of free country, but to protect it and to make and maintain the society which everyone can express themselves safely. Thus, this is why we need realignment of internet world.</p>

<p>the End.</p>

<p><br />
        Have you ever changed your favorite section or interest recently? Have you ever watch something not intendedly? Have you ever chose to focus on latest news actually? or Have you ever give away your extra time to watch something fun accidently?
<br />
<br />
What if you are doing something in the way whatever you choose, but <strong>that someting</strong> is actually exquisitely sorted by someone? What if you are <strong>actively</strong> selecting what to watch but you are <strong>passively</strong> watching something which is the most viewed post or video?

  <p>I watched a movie that has been like a lifelong homework.<br /><br />Every time I renew my to-watch-list, this movie has been never gone away.

<p><br /></p>

<p>        Is it because I saw this movie right after watching a Documentary named <strong>‘/the Social Dilemma’?</strong> The movie, <strong>‘Children of Men’</strong> was too realistic to me. While I am living the era of COVID-19, each of <strong>‘/the Social Dilemma’</strong> and <strong>‘Children of Men’</strong> has seemed to raise the issues for the foreseeable future and to show the consequences as the issues are actually presented.<br />
<br /></p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59648602/95326155-6bb9e080-08a2-11eb-87e1-9ab9f06be90f.png" alt="socialDilemma" width="700px" /></p>

<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size:.8em;">Image Copyright:Netflix_/theSocialDilemma</span></div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>The Documentary, <strong>‘/the Social Dilemma’</strong> and the Movie, <strong>‘Children of Men’</strong> give us two ideas as below:<br /></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>a) Freedom of access to information should be guaranteed?
b) Everyone has a right to freedom of expression?
</code></pre></div></div>

<hr />

<h4 id="freedom-of-access-to-information">Freedom of access to information</h4>

<p><br />
        Freedom of access to information-also known as the reason of existence of public library- is very basic human rights and the opportunity of learning. In the case of corporations which provide Search Engine, they cannot delete and censor any information and search results as they like because of this huge and sensitive reason. This policy is applied to the Search Engine of South Korea as well. To the company which delivers not only source and materials but News and current issues in South Korea such as <strong>Naver</strong> and <strong>Kakao corp</strong>, it has more impact than just policy that we can imagine. Above all, the freedom of access to information would be my first preposition from entire my twenties till now and I guess that is why this question was poped up after watching the film.
<br /></p>

<p><strong>‘Freedom of Access to Information’</strong><br /></p>

<p>        <strong>‘/the Social Dilemma’</strong> tells us that the ambitious motive which is started revolutionarily to make better place for human let people do how many things without any ethical responsibilities. In this Documentary, the design ethicist, <strong>Tristan Harris</strong> appeals that current Social Media including other services is developing in the least human friendly way.
<br /></p>

<p>        When UX(User Experience) designers project and update certain services and functions, they consider how this service and function can keep or maintain <strong>‘Retention’</strong>. I personally agree with the idea which <strong>‘well-designed service’</strong> should be based on <strong>‘Retention Data’</strong>, because valuable service means that users don’t leave the platform or play around in the service for certain time. In this criterion, Retention data is meaningful. However, it also cannot be ignored that the Retention time of users in Social Media have very closely to do with profit of corporation.
<br />
<br /></p>

<h4 id="data-equals-profit">Data equals Profit</h4>

<p><br />
        Although some corporations and some people accessed to this data for providing better service, they cannot disregard obsession of <strong>‘Retention and Conversion Data’</strong> to maintain long-lasting business. <strong>Tristan Harris</strong> assert that at this point, human unfriendly UX(User Experience) is designed.
<br /></p>

<p>In fact, it looks very ideal that the company can make profits in the middle of devising better service. <strong>But how middle is that?</strong></p>

<p><strong>‘Without leaving a certain service, they make people browse and play long or make them back to service in a short time, like right after hand over the mobile.’</strong><br /></p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59648602/95331785-c5260d80-08aa-11eb-8354-368f61ba6b83.png" alt="infiniteScrolling" width="800px" /></p>

<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size:.8em;">Image Copyright: Jay_B</span></div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>In this point, the addiction can be started and such strategies can be fatally dangerous to teenagers. The one of the most typical example is infinitive scrolling of Facebook.<br /></p>

<p>        The internet services which let people easily and swiftly access to information made people who have common interest exchange their opinions and information without any barriers and deliver latest news faster than ever. It exposes us to tremendous information at the same time. Furthermore, the knowledge that people can read and learn from books and experts, can be accessed in real time and if you cannot absorb these in time, sooner or later you are gonna be <strong>‘outdated’</strong>. Meanwhile, people have been transferred unconsciously <strong>from the era that they ‘search’</strong> what they want at Search Engines <strong>to the era that they are ‘dived’</strong> to enormous information for themselves. In oder not to be outdated and sometimes just for fun.<br /></p>

<p>        The desire that people want information as much as possible has positive function, of course.
However, when we make ourselves throw into information, what does the company which runs such service pursue at the same time?
<br /></p>

<hr />

<h4 id="stimulation-by-psychology-comes-with-addiction">Stimulation by psychology comes with Addiction</h4>

<p><br />
        Facebook feeds, pages of Chrome, contents of Instagram and etc. let us expose to tremendous information under the name of Algorithms. In the middle of these information, the advertisement exists which is based on that we agreed with collecting our information unconsciously. The value of this advertisement is assigned according to the <strong>‘Retention and Conversion data’</strong>. It is not illegal in current law, because of our unconscious agreement. Corporations make users consume contents which more people clicked and watched in order to expose to advertisement for long, actively and frequently. It is sometimes very useful, but selecting contents according to the Algorithms as the purpose above make users encounter sometimes excessively provocative or fake information regardless of user’s age and state.
<br /></p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59648602/95340745-d0cb0180-08b5-11eb-8eda-e3bf34947f7e.png" alt="retention" width="800px" /></p>

<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size:.8em;">Image Copyright: Jay_B</span></div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>        Algorithms cannot be good or bad itself. It operates exactly in accordance with how people design. However, it is also true that operation of mechanical Algorithms bring blind spot as above. Algorithms cannot decide something itself as reflecting ethical standards. This is why intervention of people is required in Social Media.
<br /></p>

<p>That is, management of corporation pursuing profitability can often drive users to where they have never imagined not intentionally, but eventually.</p>

<h3 id="then-is-this-service-ethically-relevant">then, is this service ethically relevant?</h3>

<p><br />
        If they did not intend this on purpose, then they don’t have any responsibility for the result that such flow of information has brought? The users have their own responsibility by themselves, because they connected to the service with their own will in terms of Freedom of Access to Information?
<br /></p>

<p><strong>‘Freedom of Access to Information’</strong> gives users the opportunity of learning and freedom of choice at the same time. That is why users can shut down or delete the service whenever they don’t want to use. Under this freedom of chice, it seems that so many questions are forgiven. However, <strong>learned addiction</strong> by particular functions such as infinitive scroll cloud user’s judgement quite easily.
<br /></p>

<h5 id="is-it-ever-true-that-people-can-shut-down-the-freedom-of-access-by-themselves-anytime">Is it ever true that people can shut down the Freedom of Access by themselves anytime?</h5>

<p><br />
        The necessity of intervention in access to information of Internet starts with this as ethical standards and regulations are required to maintain society and to transfer to civilised society.</p>

<h4 id="is-this-censoring-information">‘Is this censoring Information?’</h4>

<p><br />
        I mean that there is a reason that we should move forward from this question. The reason can be found at the process of <strong>answering b)</strong>.
<br />
Before that, I want to note that the right that anyone can speech and express freely can sometimes make these Algorithms more fatal.</p>

<p><br />
You can say that,
“Come on, how could it be so bad? How bad things could we take?”</p>
