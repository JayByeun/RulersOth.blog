<blockquote>
  <p>I Disapprove of what you Say, <br />
But I Will Defend to the Death Your Right to Say it <br /></p>

  <p><strong>- Voltaire</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>        I asked the questions as below after watching <strong>‘/the Social Dilemma’</strong> and <strong>‘Children Of Men’</strong> at 1).</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>a) Freedom of access to information should be guaranteed?

b) Everyone has a right to freedom of expression?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The idea of a) is presented at <strong>Civilising Information - 1)</strong>. As I mentioned earlier, the access to information should be free, but the ethical responsibility of company about this freedom is inevitable at the same time. I believe that a proper intervention rather than censorship would be required for each ethical standards of company.</p>

<p>The necessity of intervention is specified through puzzling b) out.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59648602/107339251-c49dbd80-6abc-11eb-8a64-7a0b3f3b1e43.png" alt="quote" width="700px" /></p>

<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size:.8em;">Image Copyright:Netflix_/theSocialDilemma</span></div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>        The quote above is cited from the ending scene of <strong>‘/the Social Dilemma’</strong>. This quote presents the society of <strong>‘Children Of Men’</strong> which is losing production capacity of human and the rest are waiting for extinction of human species with devastated hope. I believe that this quote shows if no matter any good will lose their balance, it could not be easily concluded whether it achieves Utopia or drives self-destruction. Even if that will was good intention, we cannot say so sure of the end.
<br /></p>

<p>As written at <strong>Civilising Information -1), the freedom of access to information</strong> brought a desire to possess tremendous information and the learned users by this desire produce another information at Social Media such as Facebook and Instagram. This production enriched those platform with full and variety of information.
<br /></p>

<p>The fact that information is getting bigger and bigger brought the increase of users at such platform and the increasing popularity of platform caused the attention of advertisers. It is inevitable at this moment that the company obsesses the users’ Retention and Conversion data for their interests. The Algorithm which is developed for this purpose results in neglecting the production of inflammatory or incendiary contents. In this aspect, the point that we should not ignore is ‘the process of the producing and learning enormous information through the freedom of access to information’.
<br />
<br /></p>

<h4 id="the-freedom-of-access-to-information-works-the-freedom-of-speech">The Freedom of Access to Information works the Freedom of Speech</h4>

<p><br />
        The <strong>‘Freedom of Speech’</strong> is one of fundamental rights as important as the freedom of access to information. This fundamental rights are also applied to the Internet. The reason why I started this writing with the quote of Voltaire(actually Voltaire did not say that) stands here.
<br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I Disapprove of what you Say, <br />
But I Will Defend to the Death Your Right to Say it <br /></p>

  <p><strong>- Voltaire</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyone can have the right of the freedom of speech in civilised society. Such right make a country avoid that one particular idea rules all and let them evolve continuously to make better world. The freedom of speech helps for people to understand something different from their idea and give them a balance to deliver their idea safely. However, these are just part of positive function. The huge freedom always comes with blind spot.
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Politics</strong> are the most famous example that such freedom of speech can be used actively and extremely.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59648602/95574997-38a45800-0a2e-11eb-9b8f-ae06e1b40020.png" alt="immigrant" width="800px" /></p>

<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size:.8em;">Image Copyright:Netflix_ChildrenOfMen</span></div>
<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="what-if-extreme-contents-are-only-spent-on-social-media">What if extreme contents are only spent on Social Media?</h5>

<p><br />
        Internet has built a space that people can deliver their political idea freely and anonymously through several process of developing. These days people refuse rather to be anonymous and try to show themselves confidently. Internet which helped to gather people and let them exchange their opinions, facts and important information whenever and wherever they want made people concentrate on what they really should think of. However, in this process, those tremendous information confronts the blind spot at the Social Media such as Facebook, Instagram and Tweeter. The result of this Algorithm is <strong>‘QAnon’</strong> which asserts conspiracy theory in such an extreme way particularly in Internet.
<br /></p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59648602/95576106-2a573b80-0a30-11eb-9df4-fc760147e288.png" alt="QAnon" width="500px" /></p>

<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size:.8em;">Image Copyright:https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54443878</span></div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>        Although Facebook held their ground on their ethical regulation about provocative comment of President Trump, they decided recently to ban all accounts which is connected to <strong>QAnon Conspiracy Theory</strong>. QAnon believes that President Trump can save the world and Trump advocated their freedom of speech. Thus, Trump leaved them to believe that he supports actually those group. QAnon is considered to cross the line because of their provocative information before U.S. Presidential Election.
<br /></p>

<p>The one of Conspiracy Theory of QAnon was ‘COVID-19 is fake’ and it has spread out all over the world, so even in Europe there were several demonstration related to QAnon. This society is well known as producing conspiracy theory with the right of the Freedom of Speech.
Eventually, the size of this society has been bigger than usual because of U.S. Presidential Election and Facebook decided as above.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="the-go-sign-of-them">The ‘go’ sign of them</h4>

<p><br />
        The extremists haven’t stopped collective actions and produced a lot of fake news. In Germany, the government started to restrict AfD(Alternative for Deutschland) which make the conflict of race, sex and politics extreme.</p>

<p>No matter which you stands between right and left, the extremist produce very provocative information and continuous expose of this information make people difficult to acknowledge what the fact is. The extreme or intense information let people getting emotional and them participate in easily without rational decision eventually. When people have the desire of participation of that, the movement which is not proved whether it’s fact or not but believes ‘it is right’ has power and became important. This is their justification and <strong>‘go sign’</strong>.</p>

<p>This extreme movement and producing conspiracy is presented well in <strong>‘Children of Men’</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59648602/95579003-1e21ad00-0a35-11eb-86e8-eec62f44d93c.png" alt="extremist" width="800px" /></p>

<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size:.8em;">Image Copyright:Netflix_ChildrenOfMen</span></div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>        In the movie, both of glorious idea with lofty purpose and the movement with hatred helped physical war in the middle of trying every possible means for their bigger goal. I believe that any other ideas and thought cannot be before humanity. When some great cause stands before humanity, the human will destroy themselves. <strong>‘Children of Men’</strong> make us imagine the result of that vividly.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="the-essence-of-human-being">The essence of human being</h4>

<p><br />
        <strong>‘Theo’</strong>, the main character of the movie, was a companion of <strong>‘Julien’</strong> whom they participated in an ideological movement with before, but he became thoroughly a pessimist because of the reality that make people lose their kids with their corruption and devastation. <strong>Theo</strong> has no basic goal of life to be alive and less hope than general citizens who live only for survive. ‘Theo’ is accidentally charged with protecting the last hope of human being and the last life. With this mission he is finding his purpose of life again. In the process of the mission he was helped not by people from the government who run and make laws but by <strong>‘Marika’</strong> who is refugee and barely alive. It was very impressive that he could complete the mission in the middle of flying bombs and bullets with <strong>Marika’s</strong> help.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59648602/95580930-70180200-0a38-11eb-8054-c8c236d2224a.png" alt="marika1" width="500px" />
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59648602/95580946-74441f80-0a38-11eb-882a-6a721012917a.png" alt="marika2" width="500px" /></p>

<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size:.8em;">Image Copyright:Netflix_ChildrenOfMen</span></div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>        I think that <strong>‘Marika’</strong> and <strong>‘Theo’</strong> show the most important part of human being. They represent the general people who have been at several historical war such as in this movie and in the Korean War and who have thanked the survival of the day before having political ideas and thoughts. When left guns are put on their head and also when right guns are aimed at their head, they could not help putting their hands up and surrender for living and their family. We can see those people from <strong>‘Marika’</strong>.
<br /></p>

<p><strong>‘Theo’</strong> shows how valuable that we live with a purpose even though we live only one day. Likewise, humanity often roles very important in the movies based on dystopia.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="if-so-who-should-take-the-ethical-responsibility">If so, who should take the ethical responsibility?</h5>

<p><br />
I want to say that it is for both company and individuals.</p>

<p>        Human being is very weak for temptation but human cannot easily discards their Humanity which is very noble and lofty in dark days for lawless as the movie. <strong>Human can make self-purification in the middle of chaos and disorder.</strong> This is why human can have developed the culture over the past era. This is their history and the essence of live.</p>

<p>Like we made our equality through guaranteeing the political right for everyone and like we punish pedophile with strong action and laws, we stand on the aspect which self-purification is required.
This is not to deprive the rights of free country, but to protect it and to make and maintain the society which everyone can express themselves safely. Thus, this is why we need realignment of internet world.</p>

<p>the End.</p>
