<blockquote>
  <p>I watched a movie that has been like a lifelong homework of my twenties.<br /><br />Every time I renew my to-watch-list, this movie has been never gone away like a rock. More of that the movie seems serious to play than it was very important for me. I think I have put this off as long as I can and finally I saw the end.
<br /><br />In fact, it would be better that I watched this movie now. It happened a lot over the time and tide that I put this aside.
<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size:.8em;">Image Copyright:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_Men</span></div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Is it because I saw this movie right after watching a Documentary named <strong>‘/the Social Dilemma’?</strong> The movie, <strong>‘Children of Men’</strong> was too realistic to me. While I am living the era of COVID-19, each of <strong>‘/the Social Dilemma’</strong> and <strong>‘Children of Men’</strong> has seemed to raise the issues for the foreseeable future and to show the consequences as the issues are actually presented.<br />
<br /></p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59648602/95326155-6bb9e080-08a2-11eb-87e1-9ab9f06be90f.png" alt="socialDilemma" width="700px" /></p>

<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size:.8em;">Image Copyright:Netflix_/theSocialDilemma</span></div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>The Documentary, <strong>‘/the Social Dilemma’</strong> and the Movie, <strong>‘Children of Men’</strong> give us two ideas as below:<br /></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>a) Freedom of access to information should be guaranteed?
b) Everyone has a right to freedom of expression?
</code></pre></div></div>

<hr />

<h4 id="freedom-of-access-to-information">Freedom of access to information</h4>

<p><br />
Freedom of access to information-also known as the reason of existence of public library- is very basic human rights and the opportunity of learning. In the case of corporations which provide Search Engine, they cannot delete and censor any information and search results as they like because of this huge and sensitive reason. This policy is applied to the Search Engine of South Korea as well. To the company which delivers not only source and materials but News and current issues in South Korea such as <strong>Naver</strong> and <strong>Kakao corp</strong>, it has more impact than just policy that we can imagine. I remember that the general issues used to be more sensitive for this aspect, when I worked at Search Engine part.
Moreover, the freedom of access to information would be my first preposition for entire my twenties and it did for this time too.
<br /></p>

<p><strong>‘Freedom of Access to Information’</strong><br /></p>

<p><strong>‘/the Social Dilemma’</strong> tells us that the ambitious motive which is started revolutionarily to make better place to human let people do how many things without any ethical responsibilities. In this Documentary, the design ethicist, <strong>Tristan Harris</strong> appeal that current Social Media including other services is developing in the least human friendly way.
<br /></p>

<p>When UX(User Experience) designers project and update certain services and functions, they consider how this service and function can keep or maintain <strong>‘Retention’</strong>. In my opinion, <strong>‘well-designed service’</strong> should be based on <strong>‘Retention Data’</strong>, because valuable service means that users don’t leave the platform or play around in the service for certain time. In this criterion, Retention data is meaningful. However, it also cannot be ignored that the Retention time of users in Social Media have very closely to do with profit of corporation.
<br />
<br /></p>

<h4 id="data-equals-profit">Data equals Profit</h4>

<p><br />
Although some corporations and some people accessed to this data for providing better service, they cannot disregard obsession of <strong>‘Retention and Conversion Data’</strong> to maintain long-lasting business. <strong>Tristan Harris</strong> assert that at this point, human unfriendly UX(User Experience) is designed.
<br /></p>

<p><strong>‘Without leaving a certain service, they make people browse and play long or make them back to service in a short time, like right after hand over the mobile.’</strong><br /></p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59648602/95331785-c5260d80-08aa-11eb-8354-368f61ba6b83.png" alt="infiniteScrolling" width="800px" /></p>

<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size:.8em;">Image Copyright: Jay_B</span></div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>In this point, the addiction can be started and such strategies can be fatally dangerous to teenagers. The one of the most typical example is infinitive scrolling of Facebook.<br /></p>

<p>The internet services which let people easily and swiftly access to information made people who have common interest exchange their opinions and information without any barriers and deliver latest news faster than ever. Nevertheless, it expose us to tremendous information at the same time. Furthermore, he knowledge that people can read and learn from books and experts can be accessed in real time and if you cannot absorb these in time, sooner or later you are gonna be ‘outdated’. Meanwhile, people have been transferred unconsciously from the era that they ‘search’ what they want at Search Engines to the era that they are ‘dived’ to enormous information for themselves. In oder not to be outdated and sometimes just for fun.<br /></p>

<p>The desire that people want information as much as possible has positive function of course.
However, when we make ourselves throw into information, what does the company which runs such service pursue at the same time?
<br /></p>

<hr />

<h4 id="stimulation-by-psychology-comes-with-addiction">Stimulation by psychology comes with Addiction</h4>

<p><br />
Facebook feeds, pages of Chrome and contents of Instagram let us expose to tremendous information under the name of Algorithms. In this information, the advertisement exist which is based on that we agreed with collecting our information unconsciously. The value of this advertisement is assigned according to the <strong>‘Retention and Conversion data’</strong>. Corporations make users consume contents which more people clicked and watched to expose to advertisement for long, actively and frequently. Selecting contents according to the Algorithms as the purpose above let users encounter sometimes excessively provocative or fake information regardless of user’s age and state.
<br /></p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59648602/95340745-d0cb0180-08b5-11eb-8eda-e3bf34947f7e.png" alt="retention" width="800px" /></p>

<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size:.8em;">Image Copyright: Jay_B</span></div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Algorithms cannot be good or bad itself. It operates exactly in accordance with how people design. However, it is also true that operation of mechanical Algorithms bring blind spot as above. Algorithms cannot decide something itself as reflecting ethical standards. This is why intervention of people is required in Social Media.
<br /></p>

<p>That is, management of corporation pursuing profitability can often drive users to where they have never imagined not intentionally, but eventually.</p>

<h3 id="then-is-this-service-ethically-relevant">then, is this service ethically relevant?</h3>

<p><br />
If they did not intend this on purpose, then they don’t have any responsibility for the result that such flow of information has brought? The users have their own responsibility by themselves, because they connected to the service with their own will in terms of Freedom of Access to Information?
<br /></p>

<p><strong>‘Freedom of Access to Information’</strong> gives users the opportunity of learning and freedom of choice at the same time. That is why users can shut down or delete the service whenever they don’t want to use. Under this freedom of chice, it seems that so many questions are forgiven. However, <strong>learned addiction</strong> by particular functions such as infinitive scroll cloud user’s judgement quite easily.
<br /></p>

<h5 id="is-it-ever-true-that-people-can-shut-down-the-freedom-of-access-by-themselves-anytime">Is it ever true that people can shut down the Freedom of Access by themselves anytime?</h5>

<p><br />
The necessity of intervention in access to information of Internet starts with this as ethical standards and regulations are required to maintain society and to transfer to civilised society.</p>

<h4 id="is-this-censoring-information">‘Is this censoring Information?’</h4>

<p><br />
I mean that there is a reason that we should move forward from this question. The reason can be found at b) as mentioned earlier again. The right that anyone can speech and express freely make these Algorithms more fatal.</p>
