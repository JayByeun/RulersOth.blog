##### <strong>Interests</strong>

###### <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I enjoy various sports. I have played football and basketball in women's sports club for years in South Korea. After moving into Germany, I am looking for a proper team to play.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love Sci-fi, Gangster, Thriller and Zombi movies and dramas. I usually watch these when I am chilling out at home. But most of time I try to do what I wanna or should do first except for work at home. That is why I am accidentlly doing and using Mathmatics for lifetime!
